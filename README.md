# Tutorial DDIM

This repository contains support material for the Hi! Paris tutorial that I presented on the 27 Feb 2024.
In this tutorial I covered two main papers:

* Song, Yang, and Stefano Ermon. "Generative modeling by estimating gradients of the data distribution." Advances in neural information processing systems 32 (2019).
* Song, J., Meng, C., & Ermon, S. (2020, October). Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models. In International Conference on Learning Representations.
